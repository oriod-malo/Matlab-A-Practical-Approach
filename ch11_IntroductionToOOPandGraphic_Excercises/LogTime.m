classdef LogTime < handle
    
    % Create a handle class that logs the times a companyâ€™s employees 
    % arrive and leave at work. The class must have the following 
    % characteristics:

    % * As the employer, you do not want your employees to access the 
    % information stored.

    % * The class will store date, hour, minute, second and total time as 
    % properties. 

    % * The constructor function will input the data from the clock 
    % function, which returns a vector with format [year month day 
    % hour minute second].

    % * Each time an employee arrives or leaves, they must call a 
    % method LogTime that will store the new times with the old times. 

    % Include a method calcPay that calculates the money owed if it is 
    % assumed that the employees are paid $15/hour. In order to do this, call
    % a separate method that calculates the time elapsed between the last 
    % two time entries. Use the function etime. This method should only be 
    % available to call by calcPay, and the existence of calcPay should only 
    % be known to the coder
